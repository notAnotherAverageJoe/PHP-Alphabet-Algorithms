📚 PHP Algorithm Project
Welcome to the PHP Algorithm Project! This repository contains a collection of algorithms implemented in PHP, organized alphabetically by topic. Whether you're studying algorithms or just want to explore efficient solutions, this project provides an extensive library to learn from! 🎉

🌟 Project Structure
Each algorithm is implemented in its own PHP file, and the code is organized alphabetically. This way, you can easily navigate and find algorithms based on their first letter.

two_sum
The two_sum algorithm takes an array and a target value and finds two numbers within the array that add up to the target. It offers both a brute-force solution and a hash-map-based optimized solution.
